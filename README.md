# react-web-app
This a simple example of a React web app that I made to show and
test some resources of React

# Context
This is a very simple application that simulates a register form <br />
I used some resources like "Components" <br />
I made the application using "Mobile First" concept to make frontend desing <br />
I try to separate the folders in a clear structure <br />

# Goal

The main goal of this application is simulate a application structure that I could do in 
some future work or to show my knowledge in an interview

I use this example to study and implement some best practices and tools and also mount a 
git flow
